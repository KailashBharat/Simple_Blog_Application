# Simple_Blog_Application 
As the title implies, the application is fairly simple and allows users to perform CRUD operations on blog posts.


## Purpose
This application was created mainly for educational purposes.
My goal was to learn what kinds of frameworks were useful for testing. 
In doing so, I was able to write a couple of automated tests for the API endpoints that I made. 
I used **ts-jest** and **supertest** to write the tests.
